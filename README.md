Hackathon Contract

To complete this challenge we need to write a function that will help us find the winning project of the hackathon. The winning project will be determined by the average score of all of its ratings.

🔍 The Hackathon.sol contract is partially setup already. Let's discuss the setup in details!

🏁 Your Goal: Find Winner Function
Create an external, view function findWinner which returns a Project.
In this function, use the projects storage array to find the project that has the highest average rating amongst its array of ratings.
Upon finding the highest average, return the project.
